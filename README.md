# donezo-mini

**donezo-mini** is a streamlined version of the
[**donezo**](https://github.com/rhajizada/donezo.git) project, focused solely on
managing tasks through a text-based user interface (TUI) without web components.
The TUI interacts directly with a local SQLite database to manage boards and items.

## Features

- Task Management: Organize tasks into boards, each with individual items.
- TUI Interface: An interactive command-line UI built with Bubble Tea.
- SQLite Database: Data is stored locally in an SQLite database.
- Boards and Items: Create, update, delete, and list boards and items, with
  support for toggling item completion status.
